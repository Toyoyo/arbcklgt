INTRODUCTION

The Armada Backlight package is a command-line program and GNOME panel
applet for controlling the brightness of the LCD backlight on Compaq 
Armada laptops. It has been tested on an Armada M700. It is based on code
by George Acher, which was written for the M300 and has been used on the E500.
This package should also work on those machines, although that has not been 
tested by Nat Pryce, who put this modified package together.

This is a DOS port targeting Open Watcom Compiler.
